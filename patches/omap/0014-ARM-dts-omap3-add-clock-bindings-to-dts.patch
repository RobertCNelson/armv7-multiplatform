Subject: [PATCH] Add the clock bindings to omap3.dtsi that were made
 available through the omap-clock device tree driver.  Adds
 the pll1 clock handles which drives the CPU frequency, and
 subsequently the ability to change its clock speed, and
 also add the system reference clock.  Originally found
